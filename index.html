MÄRKTEN'S QUESTIONNAIRE
NOTE: English is not my native language. Though I have chosen my words with the utmost care—striving to transmute and crystallize the ever-shifting tides of the mind into reality with the sharpest precision—this remains my best attempt, one that perhaps could have been executed better. I apologize in advance if this limitation distorts the original message I intend to convey. If anything is unclear or vague, feel free to ask; I will gladly do my best to clarify.
 TE SECTION
________________________________________
Te-A. WHAT WOULD YOU CONSIDER TO BE PRODUCTIVE WORK? 
That which produces optimal results while employing minimal time and effort, yet whose impact is maximized through its ability to generate effects that multiply, bouncing beneficially into a chain trajectory of other potential effects. (consequence)
HOW WOULD YOU MEASURE THIS?
By directly evaluating the outcome, which must meet certain standards, examining how many of these were successfully achieved in relation to the time and effort invested. And, of course, by assessing the trajectory of the bounce (impact/propagated effect): how far it traveled and how many times it rippled through the world.
To me, productive work is like skipping a stone across the water: its true value is measured by the trajectory of the impact it generates. The more times the stone bounces, the more it disturbs the water and extends its wake, the more meaningful the effort put into the throw.
Productive work must always rebound—bouncing off any bodies floating above the water or upon the water itself. If it doesn’t bounce, that work has little to no value. Because then, I would have exerted effort on a stone that would simply sink inconspicuously to the bottom of the river.
WHAT ARE SOME FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT SOMEONE OR SOMETHING’S EFFICIENCY? PROVIDE SOME EXAMPLES.
One’s own constitution; which can be detrimentally affected by cognitive lethargy or mental anemia: lack of vision, structure, diligence, willpower… Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that this constitution is not solely a result of what one can actively build (the someone) but also of the resources present or absent—whether internal or external—that were either assigned or stripped away, whether predetermined or acquired (the something). In other words, while one’s ability to act and develop is inherent, it is inevitably shaped by the conditions in which one exists. And no, this is not an excuse for inaction, but rather a recognition of the interplay between agency and circumstance.
For example, you might find yourself at a riverbank without any stones to throw—an absence of external resources that narrows what you can do—or without hands—an absence of internal resources that also narrows what you can do—but how you respond to this limitation will still be influenced by your own constitutive capacity.

Te-B. THINK OF A TIME WHERE YOU NEEDED TO COMPLETE A DIFFICULT TASK. HOW DID YOU APPROACH MANAGING THE WORKFLOW? WHY? 
Generally, I don’t consider tasks difficult. In fact, I enjoy keeping myself busy completing them: both for the process and the result (though, secretly, I enjoy the results more, since I may have a hard time getting things started, but I love being in the process of finishing them), and as long as I am the one responsible for completing them individually. Because I must admit, working with others is torture.
I never, ever, ever work alongside others. Most people I work with fail to meet my demanding standards. And I do not possess the force required to move people. For this reason, in such instances, I prefer to rely more on Upheavers of Waters, those who are better at striking the world with massive stones I am incapable of lifting, creating an intense and immediate effect on the members of the body of which we are a part and who remain diluted (inactive) in the still waters of the world.
Once they have remembered their form and escaped the neutrality of the world (the stillness of the water), I then serve, by merit, as the right hand or inner voice of The Upheaver; the one who ensures The Upheaver  keep the others occupied (active) by shaping what was determined to be the optimal stone for the given set of conditions: whatever the goal or objective of that specific work may be.
When an Upheaver does not exist, I will know from the very first moment that I will have to handle at least 50% (being very modest) of the work. And to be honest, I prefer this over mediocre work. So then, it will be me, and only me, providing the main ideas, structure, roles, and timelines… and ensuring I assess who is more or less capable of handling each area, assigning them minimal tasks to reduce the margin for errors.
And that is not even the reason I say I ultimately end up doing practically all the work, but because, in the final stage, it will also be me correcting everything. Me, and only me. Every piece of it. And I prefer it that way.
Often, I mimic formulas, solutions, and components from other teams or similar projects to improve upon them, and I ask the team whether they are okay with this or that. I am not a dictator—far from it. I simply wish I knew how to interact and communicate with people. Because due to my social ineptitude, I am an incompetent leader.
HOW CAN YOU TELL APART LOGICAL AND ILLOGICAL WORKFLOWS OR METHODS OF ACTION?
I am not entirely sure what this question is asking, but I want to believe that cooperative work where I am the leader follows an illogical method of action. Because although results are achieved, they are not completed in the most optimal, coherent, or integral way, due to the fact that my independence, inefficiency, and ineptitude as a leader limit the collaborative potential of the team.

Te-C. HOW CAN SOMEONE MAKE A SET OF RULES OR INSTRUCTIONS EASY TO FOLLOW?
Consulting the original source or other existing external sources that share a similar structure with which the individual is already familiar. For example, it could be that the person has already undergone a similar process or knows someone who has experienced the same procedure. By comparing internal and external sources, one can gain a broader understanding of the context and nuances involved. Also breaking the task into smaller, manageable segments can help focus on one part at a time, making the process in its entirety seem less overwhelming.
WHEN PEOPLE AREN’T PROPERLY FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS OR PROCEDURES, HOW DO YOU CORRECT THEM? WHEN SHOULD YOU?
I will assume that these inaccuracies definitely affect me in some way because we are part of the same body and given that it is only in this context that I would be interested in correcting them. Then, as I have said before, I will address the issue directly myself depending on how disastrous the fault may be. I can’t afford to place my trust in an inept person again (pathological). They will correct it themselves depending on the development they have been achieving through each of the stages… which is more likely to be minimal.

Te-D. WHAT WOULD YOU CONSIDER A NORMAL LEVEL OF ACTIVITY? IS IT ALWAYS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THIS? WHY OR WHY NOT?
Well… I am always doing something. Some things, to be precise. Always.
Contrary to how I am perceived by the world, I am a highly hyperactive person. On the outside, I may look like a statue, but inside me, there is always something bouncing off my walls, desperate to escape into the real world.
I cannot stay still doing nothing without feeling an itch in my body. And not only that, whatever escapes into the world must have an effect on something else. And the further this ripple reaches the real world, the better. It cannot be just because. Even when the goal is to "relax."
When I “relax,” that activity must be accompanied by something that provides me with some level of utility; it must bounce back to me. Even in the smallest and most seemingly insignificant ways. Basic, everyday example: When I draw or play a game, I am almost always listening to audiobooks or podcasts. Or if I need to complete a task at a physical location, I make sure not to invest my time and effort in just that one activity (note: rereading this I just noticed I even do this in most cases where the activity is not recreational). If there is no other task I can accomplish while I’m there, no matter what it is, I won’t go. Because it likely wouldn’t be worth it.
For me, this is “normal.” And this is how it must be: two or more activities at once. It won’t work if I do only one (even if others would consider that one task productive). I would surely become restless because I am always thinking that I could be making better use of my time and effort. Time is my abyssal fear. Since my early adolescence, I have been deeply afraid of being swallowed up by it. And I still fear it, now more than ever.
So, as you can see, of course, it is necessary and important for me to maintain this level of activity. My life has no value whatsoever if I am doing nothing—if I am not throwing rocks that finely and elegantly stir the waters of a neutral indifferent world that does not recognize me as its own and from which I am, often, separated. My self-esteem, shape, and well constitution depends entirely on the quality of the things I have produced—or failed to.
HOW CAN YOU TELL IF SOMEONE IS OVEREXERTING OR UNDEREXERTING THEMSELVES?
Okay, first I’d like to acknowledge that I may have a bias regarding this question that could prevent me from answering it impartially. This is because I don’t see anything inherently wrong with overexerting oneself—so long as (1) the deterioration caused by overexertion does not harm external agents in the same way, and (2) the deterioration is as heavy as the indemnity. After all, we deteriorate even by doing nothing; in this other case, one would merely be accelerating the process, but in exchange for an indemnity that might even outlive them. (Like the profits of a company someone wore themselves down building, or a novel whose words remain long after the last flame of its author’s soul has been consumed) In fact, I even consider this voluntary deterioration desirable. Why?
As I have said before, deterioration is a fate no one escapes. The body wears down, the mind tires, and death is the only immovable certainty. However, if this decay is inevitable, then the greatest possible defiance against death is to consciously decide how to wear oneself down. Instead of allowing time to consume us passively, we can choose to accelerate the process—but with purpose.
The key difference lies in volition. If death is an imposed end, voluntary deterioration becomes a game against it: you do not wait for its arrival passively; you get ahead of it, you challenge it, you make yourself its equal. In one of my favorite films The Seventh Seal (1957), Antonius Block plays chess with Death, postponing it while he searches for meaning. His terror is not in dying, but in dying without having left something meaningful behind. In this sense, overexerting oneself—when chosen and directed—is an act of metaphysical defiance, a personal duel against the senselessness of entropy.
Furthermore, this voluntary deterioration can serve as a path to immortality—not in a biological sense, but in the persistence of one’s work. A body perishes, but a creation can endure: a written piece, a discovery, an enterprise. In this sense, the erosion of the individual is not loss, but transmutation. It is about converting the energy of existence into something greater than life itself.
Thus, overexerting oneself is not only desirable—it is the ultimate assertion of (some) autonomy in the face of death. If we are to be destroyed regardless, then let it be on our own terms, sculpting with our own effort the mark we will leave on the world. In the end, like Antonius Block, we can look Death in the eyes and accept its arrival, knowing that we have played our game well.
Now, attempting to answer the question, we can determine whether someone is overexerting or underexerting themselves not only by (1) examining how many segments of the intended structure have been covered (quantity) and (2) how sharply they have been chiseled to form a unique and unrepeatable result (quality), but also by  (3) the imprint of the creator's wear on the final work.
Extreme effort leaves marks on the outcome—not only in its scope or precision, but in the exclusivity of its dedication, in the extent to which the work itself conveys the intensity of its process. If the final product bears no trace of struggle, sacrifice, or a singular imprint that distinguishes it from any other creation, we might suspect that the person was underexerting themselves. Conversely, if the work bears scars in ways never before wounded, then we will know that they have been overexerting themselves. The scar might not always be visible, but it is felt. It is something that, when you see the final work, you know that someone poured themselves into it completely—and that devotion has been immortalized in what they left behind.





Te-E. THINK OF AN ACTIVITY YOU’RE INTERESTED IN WHICH REQUIRES CERTAIN PHYSICAL OR MECHANICAL SKILLS. 
I am bad at both. Really bad… swimming?
WHAT MAKES THESE TECHNIQUES EFFECTIVE OR INEFFECTIVE?
I would certainly do research through images and videos to help me determine this. A good technique is efficient because it allows the swimmer to move quickly through the water, with minimum effort and maximum performance. A bad and inefficient technique produces the opposite effect, that much is obvious.
HOW AWARE ARE YOU OF YOUR OWN PERFORMANCE?
Very aware. I have always been my harshest critic. Every action I take, every word I write, and every decision I make undergoes relentless scrutiny in my mind. I do not merely reflect on my performance; I dissect it, analyze its flaws, and compare it to an unattainable ideal. Even in moments of success, I find myself questioning whether I could have done better, whether I missed an opportunity to refine my approach or make a greater impact. (I will certainly do this with this questionnaire; “Oh, I should’ve change or say this in addition”).
This self-awareness is not just a tool for improvement, it is a burden I carry constantly. It creates an internal conflict between the need to act and the fear of creating something defective. For if what comes from me is flawed, then I too am flawed, and I deserve to be destroyed; the world deserves better machines. I am replaceable. I could repair myself, but the wound is often too deep. I simply cannot live knowing I made a mistake. It’s the self-destruct code of my software. I must leap from my ivory tower, from the heavens like the fallen angel. The flame will be too intense, and when it is finally quelled, little of me will remain. I will be something else. Something that lost all its worth in the fire.
The weight of my own expectations often makes it difficult to appreciate my achievements, as my mind is already fixated on the next hurdle, the next test of my abilities. I do not allow myself complacency. I demand precision, coherence, and depth in all that I do, and when I fail to meet these standards, I am the first to condemn myself. I live tormented by it.

FE SECTION________________________________________
Fe-A. TO WHAT EXTENT DOES SOMEONE’S EMOTIONAL STATE AFFECT A PERSON’S BEING? 
I think a lot. I believe that most of the world's problems are caused by emotional and visceral people (not in a derogatory sense). I myself am one of them, trying to break free from carnality. (He will never succeed—lil bro is not a machine that simply discards the parts of itself it deems useless to replace them with improved ones. But believing, lying to himself that he is and that he will, keeps him functioning).
HOW DOES YOUR EMOTIONAL STATE AFFECT YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE?
I’m not sure… But is there really anyone who would say “in any way at all”? 
Most of the time, I’m only aware of my own emotional state in three cases:
(1) When I have failed at a goal (any goal, even the most trivial one), which degrades the illusory elevated perception I have of myself. In that moment, depending on the magnitude of the mistake and the height of my ivory tower, I will fall into an abyss of shame. A truly incapacitating shame, one so palpable in my bones that shatters them into dust and leaves me crippled.
Although this one rarely happens, since my lips never open: (2) when I need to actively interact face to face with people with whom I am obliged to frequent. Every interaction is a looming invasion of the home of a being hidden within his armor. I cannot allow anyone to climb my tower. I cannot allow anyone to come close—I don’t want them to attribute to me the qualities of a man. A man has flaws; I cannot be perceived as one of them.
(3) When among the vastness of the world I find and interact with objects that reflect and share specific segments of my essence. This one is the most common among all three. Even at times, I find myself truly desperate to find objects that allow me to see, touch, or feel myself, to remember my form. In fact, this is the main reason why I am interested in typology systems. It was when I finally realized that, among all people, there are those with attitudes truly similar to mine.
WHEN DOES YOUR TRUE EMOTIONAL STATE DIFFER FROM WHAT YOU EXPRESS?
All the time. Every damn time. (This is not an exaggeration. It is definitely NOT an exaggeration.) The question should be reversed. And even then, I wouldn’t have an answer.

Fe-B. HOW IMPORTANT IS IT FOR SOMEONE TO BE INSPIRED AND EXCITED ABOUT WHAT THEY’RE DOING? WHY?
I don’t know. I really don’t know. It’s a restorative feeling (?) I guess, but I don’t think I value it beyond the results it can produce. I suppose I envy those who aren’t as pessimistic and apathetic as some of us. I suppose that’s exactly the driving force of people, the very thing some of us so sorely lack to stop abandoning things so often.
HOW CAN PEOPLE ACTIVELY INSPIRE OTHERS?
I wasn’t born with this gift, sorry—I have no idea, and I don’t care. Even less so if it involves oral word. Words have the power to push and move the world, but in my hands, they remain weightless. But I have noticed that people compare themselves to you when you excel at something. Then they want to be like you, or much better. And that motivates them to improve. Even I find motivation this way. It makes me genuinely happy when someone tells me I’ve inspired them. Having an indirect effect on other objects is what makes me feel alive. And it’s not that I want to be alive (at least not always), but this is what makes me say, “Oh, I… exist.” But yeah, I definitely don’t think this is an “active” way of inspiring. (?)

Fe-C. WHAT ROLE DO NEGATIVE EMOTIONS, INCLUDING ANGER, PLAY IN PEOPLE’S LIVES? 
As I said before, I believe most of the world’s problems are caused by emotional people, in the sense that they allow themselves to be consumed by their emotions. Negative emotions cause instability, and the world cannot be run by unstable minds.
Note: And yes, I know there are people with more positive and tolerant views on how they should be handled, but I simply cannot allow myself to accept or embrace them, because destroying them—or, in the most tolerant case, suppressing them—is what I’ve learned my whole life. Not doing so would mean impurity or a loss of value in my constitution.
This belief is so deeply ingrained in me that I’ve convinced myself I am not worthy of belonging to the world, that I must destroy myself and cease to exist, since my mind is also, ironically, a highly unstable, defective, and discordant one.
WHAT CAUSES THEM? 
Conflictive circumstances for the individual? Duh (?). I am one of those who believe that a sane individual, and only he, is responsible for how he processes and responds to certain situations he may or may not consider conflictive.
ARE THEY INTRINSICALLY VALUABLE? WHY OR WHY NOT?
I don’t think any emotion is inherently valuable at all. Subjectively, each person may assign whatever value they wish, like how failing to control your anger and frustration until you killed the mugger was significantly valuable to you because it prevented you from being robbed, or how knocking out the bully to a stroke prevented him from harassing more people. But as I said, that will always be subject to personal experience.
WHAT CAN BE LEARNED FROM NEGATIVE EMOTIONS?
That they can save you from getting mugged/j.

Fe-D. IN YOUR VIEW, WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE CALM?
To find harmony between the inner and outer world. The integration of internal emotions with external ocurrences (which it’s pretty hard to do, actually).
HOW CAN SOMEONE REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF EMOTIONALITY HAPPENING IN OTHERS AROUND THEM? 
Hmm… I’m not sure if this is the correct way (insert heavy sarcasm), but I would simply not react. Instead, I’d remain passive. Other people's emotions dissolve into me, like cotton candy melting in water. (Sometimes, to the point of complete apathy) It may contaminate my waters with its flavor, it will certainly leave a bitter and poisonous effect inside me, tormenting me, but when they pull the stick out of my liquid bowl, there will be no visible effect, because the candy will have already dissolved. Don’t expect anything to come out of me, because even though I wish to impose a direct effect on others, I was born with some kind of defect in my constitution that prevents me from doing so. Although… (note:) I just noticed that there is one tool that does allow my constitution to influence the emotions of others (but indirectly): Writing.
WHEN WOULD IT BE APPROPRIATE TO ADJUST THIS?
I… don’t… know? My head hurts. I guess when you want someone to take you seriously (?). But why wouldn't someone take you seriously? What kind of person would you be for that to happen?

Fe-E. HOW CAN YOU TELL HOW SOMEONE FEELS?
I ask myself this question every day, lmao. How could I possibly know, when the world is one big masquerade party?
No, but seriously. Blank mind.
DESCRIBE SOME SIGNS TO LOOK FOR. WHAT ARE SOME GIVEAWAYS THAT SOMEONE’S INTERNAL STATE IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY’RE EXPRESSING ON THE OUTSIDE?
Alright. I’ll do my best just to fill this in, getting myself into specific situations, but honestly, it’s not something I ever overthink, nor is it something I particularly care to do. (Not out of indifference, but because digging too deep or getting involved in something that could* also be painful for me is somewhat uncomfortable (?). I’d rather avoid focusing on it and just move on immediately. For instance, I always smile at people indiscriminately, but if I suspect someone doesn’t like me, I simply avoid interacting with them or their environment—I’ll stop smiling at them and essentially mirror their behavior toward me. And that’s it. Period. I'm not willing to pay for an exercise so emotionally costly yet does not provide me with any form of indemnity. It's completely pointless to dig into it)
However, if I absolutely had to know how someone truly feels—let’s say we suspect this person wants to take their own life but constantly wears a mask of joy—the first thing I’d do to chip away at that mask would be (depending on our level of closeness) to ask them directly how they’re feeling or to make naïve references to vulnerable segments from which I suffer and I believe we might share. This would signal to them that they can be understood; that they are not alone. (That said, for me to allow myself to do this, that person would have to matter to me deeply, or there would have to be something within their emotional segments that stirred me profoundly)
Depending on their response, I’d ask even more subtle or seemingly innocent questions that invite introspection, testing for inconsistencies between their words and what I already know about them. And even if I don’t get anywhere—if they resist opening up—I’d likely change the subject and analyze how willing and engaged they were before, during, and after the conversation.
The last thing—and the one thing I would always do—is send them a text message, opening up sincerely myself. Not expecting them to do the same but letting them know that there is someone they can trust.

SE SECTION
________________________________________
Se-A. TO WHAT EXTENT DOES AN INDIVIDUAL’S APPEARANCE AND EXTERNAL PRESENTATION AFFECT THEM?
Well, in a world of disguises, little room for indifference there would be toward appearances, don’t you think? There would be no theater without the portrayal of characters—the delirium of embodying new skins through the costumes of each act.
That’s how the world works, idk. 
As for me, I care little about other people’s skins. I know the world functions a certain way, and it’s me the one who has to adapt to it. When I’m in the world, the only thing that matters is my own skin—how others perceive me.
HOW AWARE ARE YOU OF THE WAY YOU COME OFF?
Extremely aware. Bordering on unhealthy. No, actually, scratch that—well past unhealthy. That’s the price you pay for descending into a world you’re usually detached from.
SHOULD PEOPLE ALWAYS CONSIDER HOW THEY LOOK? WHY OR WHY NOT?
If you want to belong in the world, then yes. Simply because few will attend a low-budget play. And what’s the point of wanting to belong to the world if there’s no audience for the performance you have to offer? What’s the point of belonging if no one is there to witness the play that sets you apart—the one that leaves its mark in the collective memory?
Wanting alone isn’t enough. You must act in it. Wink, wink.

Se-B. DESCRIBE YOUR VIEW ON MONEY
Easy: I don’t care about it at all unless there’s a greater purpose behind it. And to be honest, there are very few things in this world that I actually care about that require money to achieve. I could count them on one hand.
I feel a bit of pity (and, honestly—a lot—of disgust, with a side of moral superiority) (eyeroll, I know) for those whose entire purpose in life is money. How poor one must be! (And I’m not talking about what can be touched)
WHAT CAN IT DO FOR SOMEONE, AND HOW DOES ACCESS TO IT AFFECT PEOPLE? WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON RISKIER APPROACHES TO ATTAINING IT, SUCH AS RISKY INVESTMENTS OR CRIMINAL ACTIVITY?
What do I know? I suppose for a very high percentage of people on this planet, it’s their top priority, because it’s through money that they satisfy the flesh. And for the flesh, they’d do anything, because it defines the world in which they operate. And once again, I pity them. (And I hate how hippie this sounds, but here we go:) They haven’t outgrown their animal phase. (eyeroll, I know)

Se-C. WHAT WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOUR SHORT- AND LONG-TERM MATERIAL GOALS?
Huh??? (crying emoji)
Material goals? Short-term? Hmm… to have food available when I am hungry, to have a comfortable and quiet space where I can lie down to think or write, to have a comfortable space where I can sleep… I don’t know, I’m happy with so little in this realm. And in fact, I feel no affinity for any specific place or material object. So, I can eat almost anything when I'm hungry, settle down in any quiet place when I want to think, or sleep in any minimally comfortable place when I'm sleepy.
And long-term… keeping my body alive? At the very least, not dying until I fulfill my sole purpose in it (which is the only reason I haven’t offed myself yet). Because the desire to die is there; the fear of death overtaking me is another matter. As I said before, not because I love life in and of itself, but because I see it as a vessel for something greater that needs to be accomplished.
HOW DO THEY COMPARE TO THE GOALS OF OTHERS? 
And why the hell should I care about other people's material goals when I don’t even acknowledge my own? (crying emoji).
All I can say is that without constant interaction with others, I wouldn’t even realize I have a physical form with proprieties (possessions) that I’m supposed to maintain and take care of. So, my mind isn’t wired to measure success through possessions or wealth. I suppose for many people, material things are a reflection of their identity, their effort, their ability to exert control over their environment. For me, the material is just a temporary stage.
HOW CAN YOU TELL IF SOMEONE IS STRIVING FOR THE RIGHT GOALS?
That is something only the person who is striving would know. The rightness of goals is not universal.

Se-D. WHAT MAKES A PERSON OR ORGANIZATION LOOK “PUT-TOGETHER”?
When there’s synergy and firm cohesion between all the parts or attributes that make them up within a given environment.
ARE THESE PEOPLE AND GROUPS MORE ABLE TO EXERT THEIR WILL OVER OTHERS? WHY OR WHY NOT? WHAT MAKES A PERSON GOOD AT ORGANIZING AND DIRECTING THE WILL OF THEMSELVES AND OTHERS?
Absolutely.
When synergy is present, each part or attribute of an agent, organization, or entity works in harmony, enhancing the capabilities of the others. This creates a unified force that is greater than the sum of its individual parts, allowing it to influence other agents or entities more effectively. When cohesion exists, all parts are firmly connected, without fissures or weaknesses, making the agent or entity more resilient and difficult to dismantle or weaken. In contrast, those lacking synergy and cohesion are more susceptible to destabilization or division, as their components do not work together effectively to maintain their integrity and strength. As a result, they are subject to the will of others when interacting with a more organized entity. 
A basic example is that throughout history, those civilizations that failed to establish a solid structure fell prey to more organized and cohesive entities, being absorbed, subjugated or eliminated altogether.

Se-E. ONE FAMOUS ENGLISH ADAGE IS THAT “IF THERE IS A WILL, THERE IS A WAY.” DO YOU AGREE? WHY OR WHY NOT? TO WHAT EXTENT AN INDIVIDUAL’S WILL AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR GOALS?
While I agree with the phrase and believe willpower is crucial to achieving one’s goals, it will never be enough on its own. Anyone who says otherwise is delusional. As I stated in question Te-A, the effectiveness of one’s results, unfortunately, does not depend solely on what can be actively built by oneself (in this case, willpower, being that which one is capable of actively building oneself). Rather, it is also fundamentally shaped by factors beyond one’s control that either directly or indirectly influence one's ability to act—namely, the presence or absence of resources, whether internal or external, which may have been assigned or stripped away by default or through acquisition, and either temporarily or permanently. (note: I had overlooked this last dimension in section Te-A). And while it may seem contradictory for a person with strong willpower to lack internal resources, this is not necessarily the case. They may lack them of any kind. Worse still, they may not even be aware of it. Yeah, the road will continue toward the horizon, but sheer willpower alone won’t guarantee you’ll reach the end of it tomorrow.
That being said, yes—there will always be a way.

NE SECTION________________________________________
Ne-A. WHAT WOULD YOU CONSIDER TO BE THE ESSENCE – OR MEANING – OF EXISTENCE? SHOULD LIFE’S MEANING BE PERSONAL OR COLLECTIVELY SHARED BY HUMANITY? WHY?
Esse est percipi. Or to be is to be perceived. That’s all. Do I really need to elaborate further?
The only reason to exist is to be perceived. What was never perceived, never existed. End. That’s the meaning: to be perceived. 
But perception is not just sight or touch. It is every possible way in which existence interacts with something capable of registering it. A person can continue to exist through their writings. A distant exoplanet, never seen by human eyes, still exists because its gravity tugs at a nearby star, altering its light in a way we can measure. The death of a star billions of years ago is not lost to time; we perceive its remnants in the cosmic microwave background, in the elements forged in its core now scattered across the universe. Even in the absence of direct observation, things leave traces (gravitational ripples, chemical imprints, distortions in spacetime…). A forgotten civilization, long erased from history, once left marks on the land. It existed because its presence still echoes in the structures of the world, even if no mind today recalls its name.
I am aware that my interpretation of existence, besides being idealistic, aims to be a universal and absolute principle, which it is not. In any case, any meaning that one seeks to give to existence is an arbitrary interpretation of the threads of reality. Including mine.
There is only one reality, but as humans limited by flesh, we are incapable of perceiving it in its entirety. As a result, each person will try to take pieces of it to form their own semi-reality built from threads that complement a lack. It will be up to each individual to arbitrate the void of their semi-realities. In this sense, every judgment is a confession.

Ne-B. WHAT MAKES SOMEONE HAVE POTENTIAL? WHAT MAKES AN INDIVIDUAL MORE CAPABLE AT SOMETHING THAN OTHERS?
Okay, I want to say something I haven’t said before… these questions related to the evaluation of biocognitive external agents are kind of uncomfortable for me to answer. It seems to me that the human experience is a corridor too narrow and, at the same time, so complicated to understand, and I don't dare make too many bold generalizations. I can’t pretend I know how is it to see through all of their lenses. I wrote something, but I don’t see how it relates to Ne, and I have the impression that it is not an adequate answer, or that I am being too blunt, naive, obvious, and redundant, like many of the other questions. What kind of potential does it refer to? This potential is only limited to people, right? (This is what I hate, I prefer holistic views). 
But well, in this case limited to human experience, I think greater potential to develop something exists when one is well “composed” (refer to Se-D’s answer); when there is synergy and internal cohesion among the different dimensions of the self, and how this composition interacts (harmoniously or not) with the dimensions of the external world (the different forms of “opportunity,” to mention one example). The ability to balance the internal with the external will determine why some are more capable than others. Being adaptable to the world makes you transform with it. (Note:) adapt, never dilute. 
WHEN IS IT IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THESE ABILITIES?
When needed. (???)
CAN A PERSON BE TRULY HOPELESS? WHY OR WHY NOT?
I really struggle to answer these questions. I cannot know with such precision how other biocognitive agents external to me experience the world, but I suppose so, right? Isn’t it obvious? If the composition or adaptability required to develop the potential for progress or evolution is not present, then there will be no hope. What is desired will be seen as unattainable, and consequently, one will no longer fight for it. And although we could argue that some people may be affected by a deadly cognitive blindness disease, people do not kill themselves just because.

Ne-C. WHAT MUST AN INDIVIDUAL UNDERSTAND TO PHYSICALLY AND SPIRITUALLY DEVELOP THEMSELVES?
That one knows nothing. 
Bah, if there were no word limit, I would leave it here, because ironically, it's something I somewhat still struggle to accept in a way (?), and speaking about it so positively feels hypocritical and cringe, but by reflecting on our limitations, we free ourselves from the ego (the most powerful distorter of reality), allowing us to experience a more accurate understanding of the world and others, seeking the truth beyond appearances. Recognizing our ignorance puts us in a position of openness; driving us to question what we believe, seek for more, and explore perspectives we’ve never considered.
IS IT MORE IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE FLAWS OR THE STRENGTHS THAT PEOPLE ARE GIVEN? WHY?
At this point, my answer should be extremely obvious, lmao. For me, it is much (much) more important to recognize the defects to work on them and not repeat the same inaccuracies. If we only focus on our strengths, we risk becoming satisfied, assuming we're already as good as we can be. But as flawed humans, even in areas we think we have mastered, there’s always something to improve. And to be honest, I’m not sure how recognizing strengths would be crucial. Speaking of the devil before, perhaps for someone truly hopeless?

Ne-D. HOW WOULD YOU DETERMINE HOW GOOD AN IDEA IS?
For its practicality or innovation. Or even better, for both. An idea being practical when it serves an immediate purpose in the present world through a combination of simple or easily conceivable internal elements that had been perceived before in that specific order at the time of their conception, and innovative when fulfills a transcendent purpose for the forthcoming world through a combination of more exclusive or complex internal elements that had never been perceived in that specific order at the time of their conception.
As an innovative idea increases the complexity of its combinations, it moves further from the present world, making it harder to perceive or apply immediately. What begins as a groundbreaking solution may end up transcending so much that it loses its usefulness within the context in which it emerged. It is as if we were building a Tower of Babel from blocks that only allow us to climb it from the outside, with the purpose of the idea itself sitting at the top. The higher we build, the further it drifts from the earth, eventually becoming unreachable or useless to those below—or to those unable to breathe beyond the atmosphere. Alternatively, excessive complexity without cohesion, or with blocks too fragile, may render the structure unstable, causing it to collapse before ever reaching the sky. The same happens with certain innovative ideas: they may be too advanced for their time, remain purely theoretical, or fail to find application until the world catches up to them.
Thus, a practical idea seeks efficiency, avoiding unnecessary complications, while an innovative idea explores uncharted possibilities, reshaping the way we understand or interact with the world. An idea can be both when it’s composed of elements before conceived in a specific order (proven to work before) and others never before conceived in that specific way, successfully transforming the future without losing efficiency in the present—an ideal outcome in most cases.
DO THESE IDEAS NEED TO BE REALISTIC TO BE WORTHWHILE?
They do not, that will depend on the field in which they are developed.
HOW WOULD YOU DIFFERENTIATE A PROMISING OPPORTUNITY FROM A DEAD END?
By the relationship between long-term and short-term consequences.
In a dead end, short-term repercussions often seem light, manageable, or even invisible, but in the long run, they become so heavy that they feel crushing or suffocating. This happens because short-term consequences are not severe enough to alert the individual to the long-term negative effects. The individual might feel comfortable when focusing only on the short term, but that false sense of ease eventually turns into an unbearable burden as time progresses.
In a promising opportunity, the opposite occurs: short-term repercussions often appear overwhelming or oppressive, yet after enduring the initial strain, they catalyze into a more manageable and lighter long-term outcome.
For example, in making a career decision, choosing a promising opportunity may require long working hours, taking on challenging responsibilities, and facing significant stress in the short term. However, those sacrifices translate into lasting rewards—success, stability, and recognition—which, in the long run, become liberating. Conversely, opting for a dead-end path may initially provide a comfortable, low-pressure scenario (such as taking an undemanding job). However, over time, that lack of ambition or growth leads to dissatisfaction, stagnation, or frustration, with increasingly severe and crushing consequences.

Ne-E. WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR SOMEONE TO UNDERSTAND THE "ESSENCE" OF SOMETHING?
Again, I can’t tell you what it meant for Johnny or The Butcher, but I can tell you what it meant for me: that the vital parts that keep something uniquely and exclusively configured (its coverage) were identified and deconstructed to reveal its intrinsic form or identity: that which makes it what it is.
WHEN SHOULD SOMEONE PRIORITIZE UNDERSTANDING THE CORE CHARACTERISTICS OF A PHENOMENON?
The question should be when should they not. And even for that, I don’t have an answer… When you intend to bring yourself down to the world, I suppose?
THINK OF A TOPIC OR FIELD OF INTEREST YOU ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE IN. WHAT DO YOU THINK LIES AT THE ESSENCE OF IT?
Writing.
By identifying and deconstructing the vital parts of writing that keep it uniquely configured as what it is, we might mention:
•	Communicative Purpose
•	Material projection of the ideal world
+	Physical body of the world of ideas
-	composed of signs and organizational codes
•	Transcendent over time
+	Immortalizer of the conscious being
•	Compilation of experience and perspective
+	Source of timeless wisdom
•	Space for communication of consciousnesses
+	Symbolic space of interpretation and changing meanings
+	Ability to impose and leave an effect on interacting agents
Thus, its form is revealed to us as: the material and timeless projection of human consciousness, organized in signs and codes, with the purpose of communicating and/or compiling experiences in a symbolic space where consciousnesses interact and interpret meanings with the ability to influence.
WHAT DOES THIS SUGGEST ABOUT THE WAY PEOPLE SHOULD APPROACH IT?
That it should be approached with intention and clarity, with a sense of responsibility, care, and reflection. Recognizing that words have the power to influence, immortalize, connect, and destroy minds through time.

TI SECTION________________________________________
Ti-A. WHAT WOULD YOU UNDERSTAND AS AN INDIVIDUAL’S BASIC NEEDS?
As a never-ending deficiency or deterioration in one's constitution that requires never-ending compensation to ensure optimal functioning. As that cyclical lack that craves restitution to achieve a fleeting equilibrium, driving us—in our degraded and inherently flawed human condition—to act ceaselessly, seeking and re-seeking in a world that consumes us and, in turn, longs to be consumed perpetually.
ARE THESE THE SAME FOR EVERYONE?
No, since not everyone possesses the same structure, and not everyone prioritizes and impairs the same segments within that structure.
TO WHAT EXTENT DO PEOPLE RELY ON OTHERS TO GET THEIR NEEDS MET?
To the extent that the deterioration of a particular segment of their structure exceeds what they can compensate for by themselves within the network of interdependence in which they participate. This reliance is never absolute nor can it ever be entirely eradicated, as there will always be some form of exchange with something or someone. Autonomy is an illusory and relative ideal. It is precisely this reality that compels us to form societies: a process in which we "devour" specific and abundant segments within others' structures (where "other" does not necessarily refer to an individual, but to any entity that, in a semi-autonomous manner, chooses to contribute to the network with its attributes—its "structural capital") in order to compensate for our own deficiencies. This exchange is not always direct with what we have "devoured" but forms part of the vast web of interdependence in which we are also "devoured" in the same way, at semi-autonomous will, in the segments where we are most abundant. Even the misanthropic hermit who pride themselves on being asocial, self-sufficient, and completely independent does so by employing knowledge, resources, or influences that they have once consumed from this broader social network (not to mention their reliance on other external structures and natural resources).
AT WHAT POINTS DOES THIS BECOME OVERRELIANCE OR UNDERRELIANCE?
It becomes overreliance when an entity relies so heavily on others for compensation that they lose the ability to semi-autonomously contribute to the interdependence network. For example, they might become so dependent that they can no longer (1) identify which specific segments of their structure are deteriorating and require compensation, or (2) determine how much and to what extent of their own "structural capital" (i.e., what is strong or prioritized within their constitution) they are willing to offer others to satisfy their deficiencies, thus rendering them useless within the world's network.
Honestly, I have no issue with insufficient dependence, and perhaps because of this bias, I find it harder to answer. But aside from the obvious, one could say that it becomes insufficient when an entity fails to properly utilize the available support network, allowing certain segments of their structure—left neglected due to the prioritization of others deemed more relevant—to deteriorate and, as a result, never fully develop. In the case of the hermit who avoids all interaction with the network of interdependence, while they may seem more autonomous, they are in reality allowing certain needs (social, emotional, or even material) to deteriorate without compensation, which limits their ability to act beyond what is strictly necessary for survival. In both extreme forms of reliance (excessive and insufficient), essential segments for life in society remain underdeveloped.

Ti-B. HOW DO PEOPLE GAIN LEVERAGE, POWER, AND RESPECT FROM OTHERS? IS IT SOMETIMES NECESSARY TO USE THREATS, FEAR, AND PUNISHMENT TO ACCOMPLISH THIS? WHY OR WHY NOT?
Hmm, I think my answer is predictable at this point. But I don’t want to just repeat what I’ve already said about constitution, so… To wield power, one requires the immediate and devastating force of The Upheaver of Waters—the one who breaks surfaces (wills) abruptly. To wield influence, one requires the lasting calculation and subtlety of The Stone Skipper—the who casts a stone with such precision that its ripples can expand toward distant areas (minds and hearts) without losing their fineness. And respect is another matter altogether, as it cannot be imposed through threats, fear, or punishment (unlike the first two, which can function in the short term through these means). Respect is built through consistent actions, through the ability to do what one claims to be capable of doing. It is through the respect one can earn for themselves by their own actions that someone as physically weak and feeble as I am can still earn admiration from someone as strong and imposing as The Upheaver.

Ti-C. ONE COMMONLY USED IDIOM IS THAT “EVERYTHING HAS ITS PLACE.” WHAT DOES THIS MEAN TO YOU? HOW DO THINGS BEING “IN THEIR PLACE” CONTRIBUTE TO ORDERLINESS? 
The human structure of the world has been deliberately constructed by men in a certain way (note: this construction not being simply a set of tangible systems or social frameworks, but also a network of interconnected meanings, perceptions and semi-realities), and it is the duty of those who wish to conceive of this world as their own to (1) engage with the vital deeper principles that keep the world exclusively configured as what it is (by covering and uncovering as many of its dimensions as possible) and (2) uphold this established order and coherence, ensuring that even when reconfigurations are necessary, they occur within this framework, preserving the fundamental structure while adapting it to new needs or circumstances, in order to continue the work that has given our species purpose since its inception: the pursuit of understanding and organization of the environment around us and beyond. Beyond this known world lies only chaos and discouraging turmoil: confusion, a void where meaning itself dissolves. This is why everything within this construction has its place. Thus, every piece within a block of this structure holds a specific location or function that ensures uninterrupted operation and order.
DO YOU AGREE WITH THE IDIOM? WHY OR WHY NOT?
Who wouldn’t. Order facilitates purposeful interaction. By reducing turmoil, it allows everything to flow and develop with direction efficiently.

Ti-D. WHAT MAKES HIERARCHIES WORK? 
Note: For this subsection of Ti, I will assume we are specifically discussing the hierarchy of people; otherwise, I could afford to be holistic.
They work because not everyone is competent in the same segments, and those who can afford to give in abundance must and deserve to be classified according to the rarity or exclusivity of what they can contribute to the network.
WHEN ARE THEY APPROPRIATE TO USE, AND WHAT DO THEY PROVIDE TO PEOPLE?
These kinds of questions pmo. It will be appropriate to use them when efficiency is needed. Duh (???). And that is exactly what they provide: efficiency. Period.
SHOULD THEY ALWAYS STRIVE FOR EQUALITY AND JUSTICE? WHY OR WHY NOT?
This makes no sense in my head. If we fight for everyone to be equal (which we are not, in the sense that not all of us can contribute the same in equal measure), then the hierarchy would be destroyed—since its very purpose is to classify us based on the exclusivity of what we can produce. […] And if it works (fulfilling its role without creating more problems than it solves), then it is just.
Why would you dismantle a functional structure just to enforce an equality that would render it inefficient, given that not everyone can contribute the same with the same efficiency? That is, in fact, unjust.

Ti-E. WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR SOMETHING TO BE LOGICAL? IS THIS THE NORM?
That said "something" follows a structure and internally coherent principles, such that its parts do not contradict each other when related, and these internal relationships align with, resonate with, or can be compared to an objective reference, a correspondence, or a coherence with the real world or broader principles that we consider objective or valid. And, of course (redundancy aside) this reference must remain coherent when introduced to interact in the same way within the internal system. It’s as if a double validation from two worlds makes it doubly rational.
You get it, right? I mean, it’s not just about internal structure (the rules of the game within a system), but also about whether those rules can "resonate" or "align" with what happens in the real world—and that this external interaction must also be coherent. If it isn’t, then the system or idea becomes illogical, even if it is internally consistent.
And yes, this is the norm. Logic is the norm. It is a system of rules (a norm) defined by humans to bring coherence to thought and reality. Or at least, that’s how I see it. I know that within philosophy, mathematics, programming, and other fields, there are different perspectives on logic, but this is my best attempt (limited by my defective constitution) to “trap” it, from all the possible definitions of which I have cognition.
PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING LOGICAL AND ILLOGICAL AND COMPARE WHAT MAKES THE FIRST LOGICAL AND THE SECOND NOT.
If maple leaf and rose petal together are dandelion, when dandelion with dandelion are cherry blossom, and cherry blossom and maple leaf subtracted are sunflower, then rose petal together with dandelion are sunflower.
This is logical because: 
(1)	Each part of the system connects to the next without contradiction. The relationships between the elements are consistent with the previously established logic. 
To see this clearly, we can assign letters to each element of the system to simplify the relationships, and arithmetic operators that describe how they relate:
	Maple leaf (A) + Rose petal (B) = Dandelion (C) → A + B = C
	Dandelion (C) + Dandelion (C) = Cherry blossom (D) → C + C = D
	Cherry blossom (D) – Maple leaf (A) = Sunflower (E) → D – A = E
	Rose petal (B) + Dandelion (C) = Sunflower (E) → B + C = E
Our example would then be the same as saying: if “A+B=C” when “C+C=D” and “D-A=E” then “B+C=E”. I have no idea about formal logic, but formally, I remember from my superficial logic class five years ago that this could be expressed like this: “(P1 ∧ P2 ∧ P3) → P4”.
(2)	Additionally, apart from the arithmetic operators, if we introduce numerical values for the flowers (as “A = 1”, “B = 2”, “C = 3”, “D = 6” and E = 5) as an external objective reference, the numbers also align with the relationships in the system. The internal logic (the structure of relationships between the elements) is valid, and when tested with numerical values, it holds true.
	A + B = C → 1 + 2 = 3 (true)
	C + C = D → 3 + 3 = 6 (true)
	D – A = E → 6 – 1 = 5 (true)
	B + C = E → 2 + 3 = 5 (true)
The numbers would then act as an objective “mirror” reflecting the system’s internal coherence. Our example is not just a mere play on words, then. If the flowers were merely arbitrary symbols without an underlying numerical relationship, the system would be merely abstract, pointless, and would not 'resonate' with anything external that grants it the sense or meaning of the other world. But by assigning numerical values, we create a bridge between the two worlds, giving it weight, direction, and anchorage in an ultimate logical reality. You see what I mean, right?
That is, without numbers, the flower system would be like a castle in the air: interesting, but without foundation. With numbers, the castle rests upon a solid base, resonating with something greater than itself (the earth). This is what gives the castle meaning, purpose, utility, what makes it logical.
And at this point, is it really necessary to explain what wouldn't be logical? Well...
If maple leaf and rose petal together are dandelion, when dandelion with dandelion are cherry blossom, and cherry blossom and maple leaf subtracted are sunflower, then rose petal together with dandelion are cactus.
	A + B = C → 1 + 2 = 3 (true)
	C + C = D → 3 + 3 = 6 (true)
	D – A = E → 6 – 1 = 5 (true)
	B + C = F → 2 + 3 = 5 (!!!)
This is ilogical because of: 
(1)	Lack of external resonance: F and E are separate elements and not equivalent. By assigning numbers, and following the relationships defined within the system, ‘B + C = 5’ would correspond to ‘E,’ not to ‘F.’ If B + C is already defined in the system as E, then stating that B + C = F introduces an inconsistency with respect to a potential external value (the assignment of numbers in this case). If E had a clear numerical value, and suddenly B + C results in something else (F), then the system can no longer anchor itself to an objective external reference.
(2)	Internal contradiction: Within the system, each established relationship must be consistent with the previous ones. Introducing F breaks the deductive chain, as there is no rule connecting F with the rest, and furthermore, B + C, without prior justification through a rule that allows it, cannot be both E and F at the same time, thus they contradict each other.

FI SECTION________________________________________
Fi-A. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE EMOTIONALLY CLOSE TO OR DISTANT FROM SOMEONE?
I believe emotional closeness or distance is defined by the alignment or misalignment of our emotional segments: One is emotionally close to or distant from someone when one can find either too many or almost no similarities in their respective emotional segments (not only in terms of quantity, but also in how they are distributed and structured in relation to each other). These similarities and differences not existing in isolation; rather, their arrangement determining whether a connection is formed or not, enabling—or preventing—a fluid and sustained exchange of information, transformation, and meaning between to subjects of the world.
Example: "This person really prioritizes and harms this same considerable number of emotional segments as I do, in such a way that we are almost the same person in this sense, and so, when they speak, I hear echoes of my own thoughts, my own wounds, my own joys. And even in our non-similarities, in those segments we neither prioritize nor harm in the same way, rather than creating distance, these contrasts generate an emotional reciprocity: where what one lacks, the other provides, and what one offers, the other refines. Their presence then feels like an extension of my own existence, making interaction effortless, at times even inevitable. In this way, our closeness is reinforced rather than eroded, to the point of near symbiosis”.
When those emotional segments are misaligned (not just different but structured in a way that obstructs or distorts mutual recognition) the exchange becomes fragmented, stagnant, or even repellent. Information might be exchanged, but without integration; emotions might be expressed, but without true reception. In such cases, even prolonged interaction fails to create a shared language, making sustained connection either fragile or impossible; distant.
IN WHAT WAYS CAN YOU ADJUST YOUR “EMOTIONAL DISTANCE” TO SOMEONE ELSE? FOR WHAT REASONS WOULD YOU DECIDE TO DO THIS?
Do people really do that consciously? Personally, I don’t think I ever actively adjust my emotional distance with someone; it’s not something I deliberately think about, nor something my mind prioritizes as important. It just happens instinctively (?). I mean, I don’t spend time analyzing in what ways I resemble or differ from others in my day-to-day life, but I could immediately recognize who is more and less similar to me, if asked.
Most of the time, I don’t feel emotionally close to anyone. However, when I do find someone whose emotional structure mirrors mine, the recognition is immediate, and I feel excited by their presence. On the other hand, when someone is so fundamentally different that their existence becomes impossible for me to ignore, I don’t just feel distant: I feel repelled, even consciously resentful. Although the repulsion is immediate, I try not to let this emotion completely limit my ability to observe and analyze in order to better understand what segments causes that repulsion and what underlying elements shape those differences.
In a way, my emotional distance is self-regulating: it shifts according to how interactions unfold and whether meaningful exchange, transformation, and recognition are possible. There’s no manual override.
As for why I might consciously try to adjust my emotional distance with someone, I suppose it would be to cultivate a smoother and harmonious relationship, but for me, this process unfolds naturally rather than by intention.
That being said, I want to make it very clear that my emotional closeness to or distance from an agent or entity is never an excuse to avoid forcing myself into (passive) interaction. In fact, there are times (many, actually) when staying behind the barrier is both desirable and beneficial. Remaining detached allows one to observe the world with greater clarity, through the objectification of the subject, without being absorbed by interactions, thus being able to see all angles with less subjective distortions. When there is no active exchange of information in both directions, the mere act of receiving information from an object (the objectified subject) without one directly participating can be an advantage, a shortcut, a trap. By remaining an external observer, one can understand how something or someone behaves within their environment and what strategies they employ. And when one eventually decides to actively engage actively in the exchange, one already knows its structure, its patterns, its weaknesses.
An example of this is my relationship with certain harmful ideologies and extremist discourse on the internet. I do not interact with them because I identify with them, but because understanding that these ideologies exist—and that they will not simply vanish just because one chooses to ignore them—is crucial. I cannot afford to block out or turn away from everything that displeases me, because if I do, those ideas will continue to cause unchallenged harm. Exposing myself to them, even from a distance, allows me to see what arguments they operate with, how they shape their discourse, and what makes them effective for certain people. In other words, this emotional distance is not just a protective mechanism, but also a strategic tool: a means of broadening one’s perspective of the world without losing oneself in it.

Fi-B. SHARE SOME THOUGHTS ON HOW YOU VIEW LOVE AND DESIRE.
I hardly ever think about these two, and perhaps that is why my conception of them is not particularly defined. But for most of my life, love has always been something strange and incomprehensible to me, and in many ways, it still is. I see it as a dynamic interaction that, while capable of transforming, also tends to consume a significant portion of the vital time on earth of those who seek it. In that sense, I perceive it as an earthly distraction (one that, in most cases, remains bound to the earthly, though I suppose that is not always a bad thing(?)), a kind of indemnity for the inherent solitude of the human condition.
Yet, at the same time, I recognize, just as I stated at the outset, that it holds an essential force that grants direction and meaning exclusively to our race. A force that transforms and allows us to be transformed in exclusive ways. And whoever is entirely incapable of receiving or emitting it is unworthy of being called a man, for he is nothing more than a beast among many; it is one of the essential ingredients that gives us our human flavor. When this force is resonant, expanding into a series of dynamics not limited to the interaction between two people, it becomes the most powerful force for connecting and moving the world.
As for desire, my perception is equally ambivalent. On the one hand, I see it as a vital impulse, the force that drives us to possess and consume the world. It is the engine that propels us to seek the fulfillment of deep-seated needs, whether of the heart, the mind, or the viscerae (one such need of the heart, for instance, being the precursor to love). But on the other hand, I also perceive it as a source of perpetual dissatisfaction. Desire, in its insatiable nature, can become a dependency that keeps us in a constant state of longing and suffering (the unquenchable pursuit of love as indemnity for the unfinished heart assigned to all men). In this sense, it could almost be seen as a kind of divine punishment, a condition that binds us to the eternal pursuit of something that never seems to be fully attained.
WHAT MAKES A PERSON DESIRABLE? 
This may sound quite bleak when seen solely from the perspective of the one who desires, but a person becomes desirable when their constitution presents a unique arrangement of traits that seem to fulfill the silent lacks of the one who seeks to bridge them with the other’s inner abundance—what we might call their structural capital.
Ideally, this hunger should be mutual, allowing both to devour each other in harmony and sustainability, providing the right conditions for resonant love to emerge.
By the way, I didn’t address this before, but love can also be non-resonant: when it flows in only one direction. We recognize it when the emitter is willing to give all their structural capital to the one thing they desire, expecting nothing in return—not out of self-effacement, nor from the hunger to also devour, but because, even in solitude, they long to dissolve within a shared resonance that may never come. In other words, this love is not nourished by the hope of resonance, but lives with the wound of its absence.
IS THIS THE NORM?
Yes? (this question pmo)
ARE SOME PEOPLE MORE DESERVING OF THESE THAN OTHERS? WHY OR WHY NOT?
I believe those whose segments form the most unique and exclusive combinations in both quantity and quality do deserve to be more desirable. And it's not even about deserving it, they are. They are more desirable than others. It's natural and evident. The scarcity of certain foods in a given community makes those foods more desirable.
As for who deserves to be loved more, I find the comparison with others irrelevant. Simply, those who are capable of loving deserve someone who loves them in the same sense and resonance.

Fi-C. DESCRIBE WHAT MORALITY MEANS TO YOU.
That system of rules, somehow reasonable and coherent, to which an individual adheres (and which is influenced by the architecture of the environment they frequent) in order to discern between good and bad.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR SOMETHING OR SOMEONE TO BE GOOD OR BAD?
See, this is probably the most foolish and inconsiderate interpretation of what it means to be good and bad that whoever is reading this has ever heard in their life, but I find the question so irrelevant that I am merely saying whatever comes to mind. My condolences to whoever has to endure reading this, but this would be the only context in which I would even remotely, consciously consider making such classifications.
I believe something or someone is "good" when, in some way, it enhances the capacity for meaningful interaction between two or more agents, concepts, or entities, regardless of their differences. The "good" has the ability to build bridges, foster understanding, harmony, or closeness, not necessarily by erasing differences, but by ensuring that these differences do not become obstacles. Example (1): A book may be considered good if it effectively allows the reader to connect with concepts they previously saw as distant, not so evident, or even unknown within themselves. Through this connection, the book expands the reader’s perspective, offering new insights and prompting deeper reflection on their own life or the world around them. Or (2): A person may be considered "good" if, through the most intimate unveiling of their heart, they are capable of connecting with and moving others toward a greater shared purpose (which, of course, does not harm external agents).
On the other hand, something or someone is "bad" not merely when they fail to connect (since failing to connect is not necessarily bad in itself) but when they actively and deliberately separate or destroy the possibilities of meaningful connection among those involved. The "bad" creates estrangement, division, and isolation, whether in relationships, agents, communities, or entities (it is for this very reason that “divide and conquer” is seen as a malicious strategy). Example (1): A pretentious film may be considered "bad" if, instead of meaningfully connecting with the viewer, it erects unnecessary barriers to understanding, promoting an illusion of intellectual or aesthetic superiority that, in reality, only reinforces the gap between the viewer and the story being told, creating disconnection rather than connection. Or (2): A person may be considered bad if, while seemingly connecting with others, they do so with selfish intentions or to manipulate those they consider their own, making them co-authors in the separation or violent destruction of others—others whom, for whatever reason (likely under the pretense of some supposed superiority), they deem unworthy of coexisting alongside them.
WHAT DOES IT TAKE FOR SOMETHING BAD TO BECOME GOOD? ARE SOME THINGS TRULY IRREDEEMABLE? WHY OR WHY NOT?
A reform in the constitution. One so transformative that it allows for the fostering of meaningful connections rather than breaking them, connections that do not rely on arbitrary distinctions nor privilege some elements while intending to intentionally destroy others (such as the pretentious film that alienates its audience or an X page that spreads misinformation and hate through cherry-picking) but instead allow for the integration of elements that, through transformation, no longer pose harm to others or undermine the integrity of the whole.
And although I believe that in most cases redemption is possible, something becomes truly irredeemable when the essence of its constitution is defined by destruction or separation, without any conceivable path of transformation that does not require it to cease being what it is. For example, a 'bad' book may be filled with ideas so deeply tied to harm, separation, and hatred that its 'redemption' would mean its complete dissolution, as any attempt to modify it would be insufficient to eliminate its destructive capacity.
Note: As I mentioned earlier, I would like to reiterate that this entire subsection of Fi feels too thoughtless, naive, or lacking in many more nuances, but it is what it is. I’m not trying to write a bible; I’m eager to finish this questionnaire. (disappointed emoji)

Fi-D. HOW ARE PEOPLE SHAPED BY THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILY?
What exactly does this question want to know? The way it is formulated seems quite confusing to me. I am not sure what to address exactly. But I can say that the relationship between two agents always involves an exchange of information. The quality and quantity of emitting and receiving this information are affected by the intimate proximity or distance between these two agents (refer to Fi-A). What we are is conditioned by the exchange of information with the environment we frequent and considering that the closest or most frequent agents in our environment are usually our friends and family (let's say, at least in 97% of cases), it is reasonable to infer that we are shaped by them to a greater extent.
HOW DO THESE DIFFER FROM ROMANTIC ONES?
In a romantic relationship, the highest level of intimate proximity is reached. This means that the quality and quantity of information exchanged, which shapes our perception of the world, becomes sharper and more refined. So sharp that they can cut in ways that are uniquely transformative, for better or for worse.
ARE NON-ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ROMANTIC ONES? WHY OR WHY NOT?
I don't think that’s the right word, but if “importance” refers to influence, then they indeed are not. In the sense that romantic relationships can transform us from an intimate root that a family member or friend might not be able to access in the same way.

Fi-E. WHAT CAN ESTABLISHING NEW RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE DO FOR SOMEONE? IS MAKING NEW CONTACTS WITH OTHERS AS IMPORTANT AS DEEPENING THE ONES PEOPLE ALREADY HAVE? WHY OR WHY NOT?
Allow me to be completely honest here: this question has been, by far, the most frustrating one in this entire questionnaire, and at this point, I don't foresee any other replacing it. I would directly refrain from answering it if it weren't for the word limit. Were that the case, my abstention should be interpreted however the reader wishes, and honestly, I wouldn’t care at all, as I simply want to see this question out of my sight and turn the page. Everything we have discussed, I believe, can be answered with the same concepts or ideas we've already explained: the value of emotional connection and how these connections influence personal growth, which was already touched upon in questions such as Fi-A, Fi-B, and Fi-D. Trying to re-explain it would feel like it hinders what has already been said.
In addition to being redundant, it seems to presuppose an unnecessary dichotomy between two aspects that, in my opinion, are equally important. I believe that both establishing new relationships and deepening existing ones have their own value, and there’s no need to hierarchize them or consider them mutually exclusive. Each serves a distinct but complementary function in the way individuals experience their environment and develop emotionally.
Establishing new relationships with people allows one to see the world from angles that were previously inaccessible or unconsidered. Every individual is the result of their environment; upbringing, and personal experiences being an essential part of that, so each new human bond is, in essence, a doorway to a different microcosm. Every new relationship is a reminder that the world is vaster than our individual perception allows us to see. Those who isolate themselves within their own circle risk becoming trapped in a reduced view of reality, while those who seek new connections constantly find reasons to move alongside the world.

Si-A. ONE OF THE KEY THEMES IN THE BESTSELLING BOOK “ATOMIC HABITS” IS THAT WHAT PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT IS THE GREATEST SUBCONSCIOUS DRIVER OF HOW THEY LIVE THEIR LIFE. DO YOU AGREE? WHY OR WHY NOT? HOW CAN CHANGING THE ENVIRONMENT AROUND SOMEONE IMPACT THE WAY THEY LIVE THEIR LIFE?
Bah, what else could we expand upon in this matter? 
Yes, aside from our interaction with people and the world, as we have been discussing literally since Te-A, what constitutes us—and consequently, how we live our lives—is determined by what can be actively constructed by oneself (the someone), which in turn is inevitably affected by the objects (resources; in this specific case, the external ones: the something) present or absent in our surroundings that we may or may not use to conceive, discover, and shape our own form, whether these objects have been assigned or stripped away from us by default or through acquisition, and either temporarily or permanently. Among these countless objects—as numerous as grains of sand on the earth—are people. But it could just as well be a book, a house, clothing, or money.
For example, in someone, the permanent absence of money and of people in whose environment this object is prioritized as valuable for making oneself can make the person adopt this money-indifferent form as their own, due to the fact that such an object was never considered a priority for survival in their environment. However, a slight change—the introduction of a powerful person or an environment where money is what one lives for—would mean a complete reformulation of their own constitution.
Take, for example, our previous scenario in which you are deprived of any rocks along your riverbank to throw into the neutrality of the water. How you respond to this limitation, regardless of the form you choose to take, will be influenced by what your environment has allowed you to actively construct for yourself. If rocks were never present in your surroundings, it is very unlikely (though never impossible) that you would develop an interest in throwing rocks. You might not even know what a rock looks like; thus, your constitution is conditioned by the absence of an object in your environment, stripped away from you by default (with which you were never allowed to interact) and permanently (as long as you choose to remain on that specific riverbank). Conversely, if the absence of the object is acquired and there used to be a constant permanence of the same object that jas been now forever exhausted at that riverbank, there is a much greater likelihood that the individual will begin shaping rocks from mud or venturing beyond the riverbank in search of others, since it is the interaction with these objects that typically grants form, purpose, and direction to one's life.

Si-B. HOW SHOULD PEOPLE APPROACH MANAGING THEIR HEALTH AND WELL-BEING? HOW DOES THIS COMPARE TO THE WAY YOU APPROACH YOUR OWN? WHEN SHOULD PEOPLE BE TAKING THEIR HEALTH AND WELL-BEING INTO ACCOUNT? WHY?
Oh? Oh! Oh. (nervously smiling emoji)
Faced with this question, I can’t help but wonder who am I to define how one should stay “well-ly” alive when I myself would not be bearing witness to my own words? 	And it’s not as if there were a single way to do so… or is there?
Well, I don’t believe there’s anything truly significant to be gained from merely keeping the body less fragile for its own sake (without any metaphysical purpose), given that the body is inherently fragile, and no attempt at compensation would ever be enough to stop considering it as such. You’d simply be prolonging and maintaining a life that, in the end, was wasted on the material.
What I can say is that one must ensure that physical deterioration always weighs as heavily as its metaphysical indemnification, striving to keep it in check until the very end of the road through one’s journey across the god time, with fleeting compensations: such as visiting your GP every year for general check-ups and other perhaps not so general ones.

Si-C. THINK ABOUT THE WAY SENSATIONS, BOTH GOOD AND BAD, SHAPE THE WAY PEOPLE LIVE AND EXPERIENCE THEIR LIVES.
Naturally, I would define sensations by limiting them to a preventive alarm against the dangers of the physical world, just as a car emits noise when someone tries to disturb its security system. But upon considering them more closely, without being too much of an expert, they are much more than just that. After all, it is sensations, for example, that allow us to desire and devour the things in the world, but also to repel and push them away, to move them aside and arrange them. In this way, I consider them responsible for dictating what things are there and what are not out there, receptors of the viscera to allow us to move on earth.
HOW IMPORTANT ARE EXPERIENCING GOOD SENSATIONS IN ONE’S LIFE? IS THERE A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH ONE SHOULD CHASE THESE? WHAT ROLE DO NEGATIVE SENSATIONS PLAY IN OUR LIVES?
If by good sensations we refer to those that are pleasurable to the one who perceives them as desirable, then they are indeed important. As we have explained, they drive the individual to become a more active than passive agent of the world (active in the sense that they have the capacity for change in both directions: the world changes and so do they; rather than just one: it is only they who are changed by the world). As for whether there is a limit to them, of course. The limit is set when this pursuit of pleasure becomes completely overdependent and overly passive within the interdependent network of the world (refer to Ti-A).
As for negative sensations, the role they play would be my natural response to how I conceive of sensations in their general sense: alerting us to the dangers of the world, repelling it, pushing aside and arranging those objects that together or alone represent or may represent a threat.

Si-D. CHOOSE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING: ART, CLOTHING, PHOTOGRAPHY, GRAPHIC DESIGN. WHAT MAKES SOMETHING WELL-DESIGNED IN THAT AREA? HOW DO THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS WORK TOGETHER TO GENERATE THE EXPERIENCE.
Art. Since the other mentioned disciplines are ultimately part of the same essence, why not address them all?
At its core, across all its expressions, art seeks to statically capture a world in perpetual dynamic motion, that can be just as distant as it is proximate. The more remote this world appears, the more exclusive, novel, and compelling its dynamics become, for better or worse, as mankind possesses an innate curiosity toward the unknown and the unfamiliar. Yet not all abstraction is inherently effective; what distinguishes well-designed art is its capacity to compactly and coherently integrate the maximum possible elements of this world without obscuring them, ensuring each establishes clear relationships before overlapping.
Every component in an artwork—be it a color, form, word, sound, or texture—serves intentionality. Nothing is arbitrary. For instance, a color in a painting not only fulfills an individual purpose but interacts with the entire chromatic system to serve a greater objective. This principle applies equally to compositional elements in photography, lexical choices in poetry, or notes in a melody. These elements coalesce with deliberate intention, direction, and purpose, forming a coherent system that replicates another world with near-exactitude.
Though complex, this other world then remains intelligible—susceptible to dissection into comprehensible units. Such understanding need not require professional intellectual analysis alone; it emerges through engaged observation, accessible to anyone willing to experience the work attentively. In the well-designed, each element possesses defined boundaries—a beginning and end—permitting isolation without severing its relationship to the whole. And is this very capacity for deconstruction what ensures abstraction never becomes excessive, preserving lucid connections between elements and the world they represent, inviting those able to see not only to observe, but also to understand, feel, and experience the work.

Si-E. DESCRIBE WHAT YOUR LIVING & WORKING ENVIRONMENTS ARE LIKE. HOW DO THEY AFFECT YOU?
My living and working environments exist in a state of organic equilibrium—neither meticulously ordered nor chaotically disordered. This balance isn’t cultivated through deliberate effort but emerges from my inherent detachment toward material possessions. Objects, to me, are transient bridges rather than anchors: I feel no compulsion to claim ownership over them, nor do I derive identity from their static “arrangement.” As I’ve noted before in Se-C, without external reminders—interactions with others or ritualistic engagements—I might forget I inhabit a physical form at all.
This detachment shapes how I interact with my surroundings. A hammer, for instance, holds no intrinsic value just because it exists in the world or because I am the one who wields it—even if I have been the only one to wield that hammer since I brought it into being from the world itself. The hammer belongs to the world and will always belong to it, not to me. Nothing from this world will ever be mine, not even the body I inhabit, for that too is its property. The significance of the hammer lies solely in its role as a conduit for kinetic negotiation: the hammer is inert until my agency animates it, transforming it into a vessel through which intention wages its silent war against inertia. Each strike is a dialogue between the self’s restless vision and the world’s stubborn stillness.
Similarly, my workspace isn’t defined by its aesthetic or spatial qualities but by how it hosts this ceaseless choreography; how it facilitates (or obstructs) my capacity to think and act. The desk, the lamp, the pen, the paper, the scattered tools—they are stages for kinetic rituals, where objects fade into the background and motion takes center stage. My focus is never on the objects themselves. Objects are all replaceable; the hammer is not the only thing that breaks and forges. They matter only as catalysts of connection, as bridges through which one reveals or makes manifest one’s form in the world.
I mean, if objects are bridges and not anchors, it is because their purpose is not to fix me in the material world (as that would be a waste) but to grant me sporadic manifestations within it—to assume transient forms, those of a blacksmith, a carpenter, depending on the interaction I establish with the objects (in this case the hammer) of this world. Each manifestation is not an end in itself but an impulse, a rebound, and another, propelling me ever further until I am able to reach that which transcends it.
Although it is true that this manifestation does not always take the form of deliberate action, creativity, or productivity, sometimes it is a desperate visceral struggle against the dissolution of one's own constitution—due to both internal and external causes, as a consequence of one's own alienation. It is a battle against the sense that my very body crumbles under even a minimally prolonged period of inaction, against the constitutive urge of my insides to escape and strike the world with vehemence before disintegrating; against a truly violent agitation triggered by the activity of a specific external occurrence that threatens to unravel me—much like too many Upheavers in a transient stretch of the path toward tomorrow. Thus, what in one context is a choreography of action and thought, in another becomes a pristine ritual of preservation, a means to stay afloat on the waters of the world rather than sink beneath them.
For this reason, my environment—both living and working—must indeed allow me to perform certain "ritual" activities that I cyclically repeat in each under-stimulating or over-stimulating segment of my daily life. These serve either to channel the desperate, impulsive, and vulgar attempts of my viscera to abandon my body and strike the world in the face of inaction or to direct my vision toward paths less violent or abrupt, ones that do not end up drowning my rock or my wake.
Some of these activities include: (1) walking in circles until the pain in my feet grows so intense that it subdues the violent and crude irrationality of my insides; (2) striking, grasping, or repeatedly handling random objects from my surroundings (a table, a crumpled ball of paper) that produce a dual resonance, reminding me of both my form and that of the world. This last practice I resort to in both over-stimulation and under-stimulation.
WOULD OTHER PEOPLE BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED IN THE SAME ENVIRONMENT? WHY OR WHY NOT?
Probably not? Why should they?
Throughout my life, I have suspected that I might be autistic, so perhaps my rituals stem from that. I don’t consider them to be common. I have never seen anyone else do these things, and the inconsiderate people around me (family) only reinforce this belief through their humiliations.
WHAT CHANGES COULD YOU MAKE TO IMPROVE IT? HOW WOULD THESE BE BENEFICIAL?
I think I have already mentioned how indifferent I am to the static arrangement of objects in my surroundings.

Ni-A. HOW DO PEOPLE’S RELATIONSHIP TO THE PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE INFLUENCE THE WAY THEY CURRENTLY LIVE THEIR LIVES? TO WHAT EXTENT DOES THIS AFFECT THEM? HOW DOES THIS INFLUENCE YOUR OWN LIFE?
El pasado en relación con el presente (1)
El presente en relación con el futuro. (2)
El futuro en relación con el pasado. (3)
El pasado son las cicatrices visibles del desgaste ocasionado por atravesar la incesante e interminable barrera del tiempo; aquellas heridas a las que podemos mirar hoy y recordar por qué hacemos lo que hacemos (1). El pasado es un vivo recordatorio para nosotros y para el mundo de los senderos elegidos por nosotros, ello o ellos (1). De este modo, el pasado no define el ahora (y en consecuencia no define lo que se es o será) pero sí habrá estrechado sendas por las que uno no podrá jamás saber cómo es transitar (1; 3). Esto porque cuando en el presente atravesamos la barrera del tiempo, justo como un cometa atraviesa la atmósfera, dejamos partes de nosotros atrás que se nos son arrebatadas, la mayoría de ellas irrecuperables (1), en nuestro deterioro causado por elección —semiautónoma— de caminos que cierran puentes a otros —caminos— que ahora requieren de esas partes que ya hemos perdido de nosotros para atravesarlos. (1;2)
El presente es el mero instante en el que aquellas puertas se cierran, caminos se estrechan y otras puertas se abren junto a sus caminos. (1;2)
El pasado es la estela de nuestro paso por el mundo, que continúa dando manifiesto (perdura) de nuestra existencia y la permanencia de nuestros caminos.
El pasado son las resonancias de nuestras almas en las estructuras del mundo que dan y continuan y continuarán dando testimonio de nuestra existencia, y que se manifiestan en el presente. Tanto de otros, el mundo como el propio.
